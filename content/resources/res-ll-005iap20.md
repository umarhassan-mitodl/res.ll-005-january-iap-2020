  caption: '"Big Data" refers to a technological phenomenon that has emerged since
    the mid-1980s. As computers have improved in capacity and speed, the greater storage
    and processing possibilities have also generated new challenges. New analytical
    tools, including the ones introduced in this course, have since been developed
    to solve these challenges in management of those phenomenally large data sets.
